# Usage Monitor for Claude

**Monitor your Claude rate limits in real time - right from your Windows system tray.**

A native Windows tray app that shows your Claude usage at a glance - lightweight, portable, and fully auditable. Rate limits are shared across claude.ai, Claude Code, and its IDE extensions for VS Code and JetBrains - always know how much of your session and weekly limits you have left.

## Features

- **Portable** - single EXE (~20 MB), no installation, no Electron, no runtime. Download, place anywhere, run
- **Zero configuration** - authenticates through your existing Claude Code login. No API key, no manual token entry
- **Live tray icon** with two progress bars (session + weekly), percentage display at high usage, and theme-aware colors for light and dark taskbars
- **Detail popup** (left-click) showing account info, usage bars for all quota types (Session, Weekly, Sonnet, Opus, extra usage), reset countdowns, installed Claude Code versions, and data freshness
- **Time marker** on each bar - a white line showing elapsed time in the current period, so you can instantly see whether your usage is ahead of or behind the clock
- **Smart alerts** - configurable threshold notifications per quota type, with time-aware mode that only alerts when usage outpaces elapsed time. Reset notifications when a nearly exhausted quota refills
- **Automatic token refresh** - when the OAuth session expires, runs `claude update` in the background to renew the token without user intervention. If a CLI update is installed, shows a notification
- **Claude Code versions** - the popup shows installed Claude Code versions (native CLI, VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf) so you always know which version each environment uses
- **Adaptive polling** - speeds up during active usage, pauses when the computer is idle or locked, aligns to imminent quota resets, and backs off on rate-limit errors
- **12 languages** (English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Indonesian, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional) - auto-detected from your Windows display language
- **Customizable** - optionally override polling intervals, colors, alert thresholds, and more via a [JSON settings file](#configuration)

## Security & Transparency

This tool handles your Claude Code OAuth token, so you should be able to verify it is safe. The codebase is deliberately structured for easy auditing:

- **Single network destination** - communicates exclusively with `api.anthropic.com`, no other hosts
- **Credentials stay local** - the OAuth token is used only in HTTP Authorization headers, never logged, stored elsewhere, or transmitted to third parties
- **Read-only** - the app never writes files to disk
- **No dynamic code execution** - no `eval()`, `exec()`, `compile()`, or dynamic imports
- **No obfuscation** - no encoded strings, no hidden URLs, no minified logic
- **Modular architecture** - small, focused modules with security-critical code (credentials, API calls) isolated in a single file ([`api.py`](usage_monitor_for_claude/api.py))
- **Minimal runtime dependencies** - only three well-known packages: [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/), [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/), [pystray](https://pypi.org/project/pystray/)

## Requirements

- **Windows 10 or Windows 11** (64-bit)
- **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** installed and logged in (CLI, VS Code extension, or JetBrains plugin - any variant works). The app reads the OAuth token that Claude Code stores locally (`~/.claude/.credentials.json`).

> [!TIP]
> If the token expires, the app automatically runs `claude update` to refresh it. If the token is missing entirely, the app shows a notification and a "!" icon - log in to Claude Code and the monitor picks it up automatically.

## Quick Start

**No Python required.** Download the latest [**UsageMonitorForClaude.exe**](https://github.com/jens-duttke/usage-monitor-for-claude/releases/latest), place it wherever you like, and run it. To remove, disable "Start with Windows" in the context menu first (if enabled), then delete the file.

## How to Use

| Action | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Hover** over the tray icon | Tooltip shows 5h and 7d usage percentages with reset times |
| **Left-click** the tray icon | Opens the detail popup with account info and all usage bars |
| **Right-click** the tray icon | Context menu: open popup, autostart toggle, or quit |
| **Escape** or click outside | Closes the detail popup |

### Tray icon not visible?

Windows may hide new tray icons by default. To keep the icon always visible:

1. Right-click the **taskbar** → **Taskbar settings**
2. Expand **Other system tray icons** (Win 11) or **Select which icons appear on the taskbar** (Win 10)
3. Toggle **UsageMonitorForClaude** to **On**

### Reading the progress bars

Each bar in the detail popup has up to three visual elements:

1. **Blue fill** - how much of the limit you have used (turns **red** at 80%+)
2. **White vertical line** - how much *time* has passed in the current period. If the blue fill is to the left of this line, you are using Claude slower than the rate limit refills. If it is to the right, you are on track to hit the limit before the period resets.
3. **Reset text** - when the limit resets, shown as a countdown with clock time

## Configuration

All settings work out of the box - no configuration file is needed. To customize behavior, create a file called `usage-monitor-settings.json` with only the keys you want to change:

```json
{
  "poll_interval": 180,
  "bar_fg": "#00cc66",
  "bar_fg_high": "#ff6600"
}
```

The app searches for this file in two locations (first match wins):

1. **Next to the EXE** (or project root when running from source)
2. **`~/.claude/usage-monitor-settings.json`**

The app never creates or modifies this file. To start, create an empty file and add keys as needed.

<summary>Available settings</summary>

### Alert thresholds

Configure usage percentage thresholds that trigger Windows notifications. Session and weekly quotas have separate thresholds since their time horizons differ significantly. Set to an empty array `[]` to disable alerts for a specific quota type.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `alert_thresholds_five_hour` | `[50, 80, 95]` | Thresholds for Session (5hr) |
| `alert_thresholds_seven_day` | `[95]` | Thresholds for all Weekly quotas (7 day, Sonnet, Opus) |
| `alert_time_aware` | `true` | Only alert when usage outpaces elapsed time |
| `alert_time_aware_below` | `90` | Time-aware check applies only to thresholds below this value; thresholds at or above always fire |

### Polling intervals

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `poll_interval` | `180` | Seconds between API updates |
| `poll_fast` | `120` | Seconds when usage is actively increasing |
| `poll_fast_extra` | `2` | Extra fast polls after usage stops increasing |
| `poll_error` | `30` | Seconds after a transient error (5xx, network). Rate-limit errors (429) use exponential backoff instead |
| `max_backoff` | `900` | Maximum backoff in seconds for rate-limit errors (15 min) |
| `idle_pause` | `300` | Seconds of inactivity before polling pauses (0 = disable). Polling also pauses when the workstation is locked |

### Currency

The Anthropic API does not include currency information, so the app detects the currency symbol from your Windows locale settings. If your Windows locale currency differs from the currency Anthropic bills you in, you can override just the symbol here. Number formatting (decimal separator, symbol position) always follows your system locale.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `currency_symbol` | *(auto-detected)* | Override the auto-detected currency symbol (e.g., `"$"`, `"€"`, `"¥"`) |

### Tray icon colors

Override individual channels as RGBA arrays `[R, G, B, A]` (0–255). Unspecified keys keep their defaults.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `icon_light` | `{"fg": [255,255,255,255], "fg_half": [255,255,255,80], "fg_dim": [255,255,255,140]}` | Light icons for dark taskbar |
| `icon_dark` | `{"fg": [0,0,0,255], "fg_half": [0,0,0,80], "fg_dim": [0,0,0,140]}` | Dark icons for light taskbar |

### Popup colors

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `bg` | `"#1e1e1e"` | Background |
| `fg` | `"#cccccc"` | Text |
| `fg_dim` | `"#888888"` | Dimmed text (labels, reset times) |
| `fg_heading` | `"#ffffff"` | Section headings |
| `bar_bg` | `"#333333"` | Progress bar background |
| `bar_fg` | `"#4a9eff"` | Progress bar fill |
| `bar_fg_high` | `"#e05050"` | Progress bar fill when usage ≥ 80% |
