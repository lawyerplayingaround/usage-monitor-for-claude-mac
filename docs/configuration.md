# Configuration

All settings work out of the box - no configuration file is needed. To customize behavior, create a file called `usage-monitor-settings.json` with only the keys you want to change:

```json
{
  "poll_interval": 180,
  "bar_fg": "#00cc66",
  "bar_fg_warn": "#ff6600"
}
```

The app searches for this file in these locations (first match wins):

1. **`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/usage-monitor-settings.json`** (only if a custom config directory is set via `--config-dir` or `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and differs from `~/.claude/`) - this lets every instance have its own settings when running one instance per Claude account
2. **Next to the EXE** (or project root when running from source)
3. **`~/.claude/usage-monitor-settings.json`**

The app never creates or modifies this file. To start, create an empty file and add keys as needed. Settings are read at startup - after editing the file, use the **Restart** option in the tray context menu to apply changes.

## Alert thresholds

Configure usage percentage thresholds that trigger Windows notifications. Session and weekly quotas have separate thresholds since their time horizons differ significantly. Set to an empty array `[]` to disable alerts for a specific quota type.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `alert_thresholds_five_hour` | `[50, 80, 95]` | Thresholds (%) for Session (5hr) |
| `alert_thresholds_seven_day` | `[95]` | Thresholds (%) for Weekly quotas (7 day and all variants) |
| `alert_thresholds_extra_usage` | `[50, 80, 95]` | Thresholds (%) for Extra Usage (paid overage) |
| `alert_time_aware` | `true` | Only alert when usage outpaces elapsed time |
| `alert_time_aware_below` | `90` | Time-aware check applies only to thresholds below this value; thresholds at or above always fire |

Threshold lookup uses a fallback chain: exact match (e.g. `alert_thresholds_seven_day_opus`), then base period (e.g. `alert_thresholds_seven_day`), then no alerts. This lets you configure stricter thresholds per variant when needed:

```json
{
    "alert_thresholds_seven_day_opus": [50, 80, 95]
}
```

## Update notification

When a background token refresh installs a new Claude CLI version, the app shows a Windows notification reporting the version change. Set this to `false` to suppress that notification.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `notify_claude_update` | `true` | Show a notification when a background token refresh installs a new Claude CLI version |

## Claude CLI command

The popup lists the Claude Code version of the native Windows CLI and of each IDE extension it finds. Installs it cannot see - most commonly a Claude Code running inside WSL - are missing from that list. Use `cli_command` to have their versions reported as well.

The value is an object mapping a display name to the base command as an array of arguments (the app appends `--version` itself). Each entry is listed in the popup under the name you give it, **in addition to** the native CLI and the IDE extensions, which keep working exactly as before.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `cli_command` | *(none)* | Object mapping a display name to a base command (array of strings) whose Claude Code version is reported alongside the auto-detected ones, e.g. a WSL install |

```json
{
    "cli_command": {
        "WSL": ["wsl", "/home/<user>/.local/bin/claude"]
    }
}
```

An entry only appears once its command reports a version, so if it stays missing, run the command yourself in a terminal - `wsl /home/<user>/.local/bin/claude --version` has to print a version number.

Two things worth knowing:

- **This setting is display only.** It reports a version and nothing else. Automatic token refresh keeps using the native Windows CLI, because that is the install whose credentials this app reads - a Claude Code inside WSL keeps its own credentials there.
- **The version is read once per app start.** A custom command has no local file whose timestamp could reveal an update, and re-running it on every refresh would start WSL every few minutes. After updating Claude Code inside WSL, restart the app to see the new version.

## Tooltip fields

The tray tooltip shows a quick usage summary when you hover over the icon. By default, it displays the session (5h) and weekly (7d) quotas. Use `tooltip_fields` to choose which usage fields appear in the tooltip.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `tooltip_fields` | `["five_hour", "seven_day"]` | Which usage fields to show in the tray tooltip, in order |

Must be an array of non-empty strings. Duplicates are silently removed. An empty array `[]` is valid (tooltip shows only the title, no usage fields). Unknown field names are accepted - if a field is `null` or missing from the API response, it is simply skipped.

**Known field names:** `five_hour`, `seven_day`, `seven_day_sonnet`, `seven_day_opus`, `seven_day_cowork`, `seven_day_oauth_apps`

**Example** - show session and Sonnet quota in the tooltip:

```json
{
    "tooltip_fields": ["five_hour", "seven_day_sonnet"]
}
```

## Popup fields

The popup shows usage bars for all active quota types by default. Use `popup_fields` to control which bars appear and in what order.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `popup_fields` | `["*"]` | Which usage fields to show in the popup, in order. `"*"` is a wildcard meaning "all remaining non-null fields in default order" |

Must be an array of non-empty strings. `"*"` may appear at most once. Duplicates are silently removed. Unknown field names are accepted - if a field is `null` or missing from the API response, it is simply skipped.

**Known field names:** `five_hour`, `seven_day`, `seven_day_sonnet`, `seven_day_opus`, `seven_day_cowork`, `seven_day_oauth_apps`

**Default order** (used for `"*"` and when no setting is present): shorter periods first (`hour` before `day`), base field before variants, variants alphabetically.

**Examples:**

| Setting | Result |
|---------|--------|
| *(not set)* | All non-null fields in default order |
| `["five_hour", "seven_day_sonnet", "*"]` | Session first, then Sonnet, then all remaining |
| `["five_hour", "seven_day"]` | Only these two, everything else hidden |
| `["*"]` | Same as not set |

```json
{
    "popup_fields": ["five_hour", "seven_day_sonnet", "*"]
}
```

## Compact pinned view

The detail popup can be pinned open (pin button in the header) so it stays visible and can be dragged anywhere. Use `compact_hide` to strip the pinned popup down to just the usage bars you care about - the entries listed here are hidden **only while the popup is pinned**, and reappear when you unpin it.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `compact_hide` | `[]` | Sections and usage bars to hide while the popup is pinned |

Must be an array of non-empty strings. Duplicates are silently removed. Unknown names are accepted and simply have no effect. With the default empty list, pinning changes nothing about what is shown.

Entries can be either a **section key** or a **usage field name**:

**Section keys:** `account` (email and plan), `extra_usage` (paid overage bar), `claude_code` (installed versions), `status` (the footer with the update time). The usage bar section itself cannot be hidden as a whole - hide individual bars by their field name instead. When hiding leaves only the usage bars (no other section visible), the "Usage" heading is dropped automatically, since it has nothing left to distinguish the bars from.

**Usage field names:** any quota field, e.g. `five_hour`, `seven_day`, `seven_day_sonnet`, `seven_day_opus`, `seven_day_cowork`, `seven_day_oauth_apps`. This hides that single bar in the pinned view, independent of [`popup_fields`](#popup-fields) (which controls the normal, unpinned popup).

**Example** - pin to a minimal view with only the session and weekly bars:

```json
{
    "compact_hide": ["account", "extra_usage", "claude_code", "status", "seven_day_sonnet", "seven_day_opus"]
}
```

## Tray icon bars

The tray icon displays two small progress bars. By default, these show the session (5h) and weekly (7d) quotas. Use `icon_fields` to choose which two API fields are displayed.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `icon_fields` | `["five_hour", "seven_day"]` | Which two usage fields to show as icon bars. The first entry is the top bar (also determines the icon text), the second is the bottom bar |

Must be an array of exactly 2 non-empty strings. Unknown field names are accepted - if a field is `null` or missing from the API response, the bar shows 0%.

**Known field names:** `five_hour`, `seven_day`, `seven_day_sonnet`, `seven_day_opus`, `seven_day_cowork`, `seven_day_oauth_apps`

Each entry can optionally include a display mode suffix using colon syntax: `"field_name:mode"`.

**Available bar display modes:**

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `utilization` | *(default)* Fills left-to-right proportional to current usage |
| `overage` | Shows how far usage has entered the over-budget zone: empty when usage is at or below the time marker (on pace or ahead), half-filled when usage is halfway between the time marker and 100%, full when usage reaches 100% |

In `utilization` mode, each bar also shows a thin vertical marker at the elapsed-time position of the quota period - the same information as the time marker in the detail popup. When usage is ahead of the elapsed time (or fully exhausted), the bar fill switches to the warning color (`fg_warn` in [Tray icon colors](#tray-icon-colors)), matching the popup's red warning fill.

**Example** - show session in overage mode and weekly in default mode:

```json
{
    "icon_fields": ["five_hour:overage", "seven_day"]
}
```

**Example** - show session and Sonnet quota (default utilization mode):

```json
{
    "icon_fields": ["five_hour", "seven_day_sonnet"]
}
```

## Event commands

Run a shell command when a usage event occurs. See [Event Commands](event-commands.md) for examples and available environment variables.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `on_reset_command` | *(none)* | Shell command (or array of commands) to run when a quota resets (usage drops) |
| `on_startup_command` | *(none)* | Shell command (or array of commands) to run once after the first successful API update following app start |
| `on_threshold_command` | *(none)* | Shell command (or array of commands) to run when usage crosses a configured alert threshold |
| `on_double_click_command` | *(none)* | Shell command (or array of commands) to run when you double-click the tray icon (e.g. launch [Agent Monitor for Claude](https://github.com/jens-duttke/agent-monitor-for-claude)); a single click still opens the popup |

## Polling intervals

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `poll_interval` | `180` | Seconds between API updates |
| `poll_fast` | `120` | Seconds when usage is actively increasing |
| `poll_fast_extra` | `2` | Extra fast polls after usage stops increasing |
| `poll_error` | `30` | Seconds after a transient error (5xx, network). Rate-limit errors (429) use exponential backoff instead |
| `max_backoff` | `900` | Maximum backoff in seconds for rate-limit errors (15 min) |
| `idle_pause` | `300` | Seconds of inactivity before polling pauses (0 = disable). Polling also pauses when the workstation is locked |

## Language

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `language` | *(auto-detected)* | Override the UI language with a language code. Available: `de`, `en`, `es`, `fr`, `hi`, `id`, `it`, `ja`, `ko`, `pt-BR`, `uk`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW` |

## Time Format

By default, reset times follow your Windows clock format (the 24-hour or 12-hour / AM-PM setting from your regional preferences), so no configuration is needed. Set this key to override the auto-detected format.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `time_format` | *(auto-detected from Windows)* | Clock format for reset times: `"24h"` (e.g. `14:30`) or `"12h"` (e.g. `2:30 PM`) |

## Currency

The app shows extra usage amounts in the billing currency the Anthropic API reports for your account (its symbol and decimal precision), falling back to your Windows locale's currency symbol when the API does not report one. If you want a different symbol, override it here - your override always wins. Number formatting (decimal separator, symbol position) always follows your system locale.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `currency_symbol` | *(from API, else locale)* | Override the displayed currency symbol (e.g., `"$"`, `"€"`, `"¥"`) |

## Tray icon colors

Override individual channels as RGBA arrays `[R, G, B, A]` (0-255). Unspecified keys keep their defaults.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `icon_light` | `{"fg": [255,255,255,255], "fg_half": [255,255,255,80], "fg_dim": [255,255,255,140], "fg_warn": [224,80,80,255]}` | Light icons for dark taskbar |
| `icon_dark` | `{"fg": [0,0,0,255], "fg_half": [0,0,0,80], "fg_dim": [0,0,0,140], "fg_warn": [224,80,80,255]}` | Dark icons for light taskbar |

## Popup colors

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `bg` | `"#1e1e1e"` | Background |
| `fg` | `"#cccccc"` | Text |
| `fg_dim` | `"#888888"` | Dimmed text (labels, reset times) |
| `fg_heading` | `"#ffffff"` | Section headings |
| `fg_link` | `"#4a9eff"` | Link text (e.g. changelog) |
| `bar_bg` | `"#333333"` | Progress bar background |
| `bar_fg` | `"#4a9eff"` | Progress bar fill |
| `bar_fg_warn` | `"#e05050"` | Progress bar fill when usage outpaces elapsed time, error text |
| `bar_divider` | `"#000c"` | Time dividers on progress bars (hour marks on the session bar, midnights on weekly bars) |
| `bar_marker` | `"#fffc"` | Time-position marker on progress bars |
